python is object orintted 
__init__:- is a pre defined function in python and is similer to constructer in javascript
it is called when ever er create a object using a class
it takes some arguments
self:-it is similer to 'this' in javascript
python does not need keyword 'new'
function which begin with '__' are called function as they have special function
